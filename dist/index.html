  <p>I'm Benedikt, a Web Developer based in Berlin, Germany.
Digging modern development workflows, I try to avoid complexity and bloat. I'm looking for working and learning from each other in teams. Also I call myself well experienced in creating visual designs and applying to the web for all devices. I want to stay updated on trends constantly but don't get trapped by them. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>
