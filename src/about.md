{% intro %}

As a Web Developer I focus on HTML, CSS and Javascript as it specifically pertains to the UI of apps and sites.

{% endintro %}

In my over 10 years as a web developer I mostly positioned myself as a generalist, remember the term _Webdesigner_?

In recent years I learned much more general programming techniques and patterns, and how javascript works under the hood. Among others I really enjoyed the courses of [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com) (Still subscribed).

Always interested in graphic design, I also developed skills in device agnostic UI design and implementation of these designs in web products (see: https://v3.benedikt.gr for example projects).

## What I think about the modern web

The web is a often bloated and over-engineered. I always seek to avoid accumulating too much dependencies, especially at runtime (e.g. compiling code with svelte or other tools instead of shipping the runtime to the user).

I try to stay updated on trends but never to be trapped by them.

## Outside of work

To mitigate sitting in front of the screen for endless hours, I like going for a run at Berlin's famous closed down airport [Tempelhofer Feld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempelhofer_Feld) or shoot some hoops at the many open courts around the city.

Out of my passionate hate for cars in dense populated cities, I love joining [Critial Mass](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Mass_(cycling)>) events on a regular basis to hinder unsustainable private transport and increase attention for cyclists.

## Contact me

Thanks for your interest in me, you made it to the end, very nice!
