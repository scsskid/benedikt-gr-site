I'm Benedikt, a web developer based in Berlin, Germany. While digging modern development workflows, I try to avoid complexity and bloat.

I'm looking for working and learning from each other in teams. Also I call myself well experienced in creating visual designs and applying to the web for all devices.

Always updated on trends but never trapped by them. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
