  Front To Back And In-Between: Yet Another Web Developer
---

I'm Benedikt, a web developer based in Berlin, Germany.

You can read more [about me](about/) or look at [my articles](notes/), which are rather quick notes or links than blog posts.

You should visit [my old portfolio site](http://v3.benedikt.gr/) if you are interested to see sites I built, when I was freelancing.
